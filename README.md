# Hardening Honeypot Technologies in IoT with HoneyFarm Environment

## üìå Overview

This repository contains the design, implementation, and analysis of **HoneyFarm** ‚Äî a scalable environment for deploying, managing, and hardening IoT honeypot technologies.
The project aims to improve IoT security through **cyber psychology deception-based defense mechanisms** that can capture malicious activity, analyze attack patterns, and strengthen system resilience.

## üèó Architecture

* **Components:**

  * Honeypots for various IoT device emulations, such as SSH/Telnet on Cowrie, HTTP on SNARE, PJL on MiniPrint.
  * Upgraded with psychological enhancements such as tailored responses aimed at exploiting emotional states of an attacker after identifying a personality trait based on the latter's command execution sequence. Furthermore, several cognitive biases are also incorporated throughout the system 
  * Data collection and storage pipeline.
  * Threat intelligence and analytics modules.

* **Design Notes:**
  The Cowrie nodes are configured to respond according to an a personality trait based on an attackers command execution sequence. The responses are tailored to evoke emotions such as CONFIDENCE, SURPRISE, CONFUSION, FRUSTRATION, SELF_DOUBT. Moreover, the layout and structure of the SSH and Telnet honeypot is configured to mimic a realistic IoT server with fake third party software toolkit and notes. The website is developed to represent the dashboard of a smart home IoT environment and serves as the control center for the devices. In the source code there are cues and fake scripts communicating with SSH/Telnet, and PJL servers, that aim to enhance the illusion of interconnetivity.

## üìä Data Analysis & Threat Intelligence

A customised data analysis dashboard was developed using Plotly Dash, a Python based web framework for interactive data visualization.

* **Data Collection:**

  * Log files from honeypots
  * Interaction data analysis
  * User study data analysis
* **Analysis Tools:**

  * Python (plotly, pandas, numPy)
* **Metrics & KPIs:**

  * Number of unique human attackers
  * Command execution sequence analysis
  * Average time spent on honeypot
