# Hardening Honeypot Technologies in IoT with HoneyFarm Environment

## üìå Overview

This repository contains the design, implementation, and analysis of **HoneyFarm** ‚Äî a scalable environment for deploying, managing, and hardening IoT honeypot technologies.
The project aims to improve IoT security through **cyber psychology deception-based defense mechanisms** that can capture malicious activity, analyze attack patterns, and strengthen system resilience.

## üèó Architecture

> *Placeholder ‚Äî Insert diagrams and explanations of the HoneyFarm system architecture here.*

* **Components:**

  * Honeypots for various IoT device emulations.
  * Central management & orchestration system.
  * Data collection and storage pipeline.
  * Threat intelligence and analytics modules.
* **Diagram:**
  *Add a high-level architecture diagram (e.g., using Mermaid, Draw\.io, or Lucidchart) here.*
* **Design Notes:**
  *Explain the data flow, interaction between honeypots, and network segmentation.*

If you‚Äôd like, I can make you an **ASCII-style HoneyFarm architecture diagram** that you can drop right into this README as a placeholder before you add the final graphic. That would make the repo look ‚Äúalive‚Äù even before the real diagram is ready. Would you like me to do that?
